**Docker:**

1. **Container Lifecycle:**
    
    * Build an image from a Dockerfile: `docker build -t <image_name> <dockerfile_path>`
        
    * Run a container from an image: `docker run <image_name>`
        
    * List running containers: `docker ps`
        
    * Stop a running container: `docker stop <container_id>`
        
    * Remove a container: `docker rm <container_id>`
        
    * List available images: `docker images`
        
    * Remove an image: `docker rmi <image_id>`
        
2. **Container Networking:**
    
    * Create a network: `docker network create <network_name>`
        
    * Run a container within a network: `docker run --network <network_name> <image_name>`
        
    * Expose container ports to the host: `docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>`
        
    * Link containers: `docker run --link <container_name>:<alias> <image_name>`
        
        1. **Docker Compose:**
            
            * Define services in a Compose file (docker-compose.yml)
                
            * Start containers defined in the Compose file: `docker-compose up`
                
            * Stop containers and remove resources: `docker-compose down`
                
            * Scale services: `docker-compose up --scale <service_name>=<num_instances>`
                
        
        **Kubernetes:**
        
        1. **Kubernetes Objects:**
            
            * Create or apply a resource from a YAML file: `kubectl apply -f <filename.yml>`
                
            * Get resource information: `kubectl get <resource_type>`
                
            * Describe a resource: `kubectl describe <resource_type> <resource_name>`
                
            * Delete a resource: `kubectl delete <resource_type> <resource_name>`
                
        2. **Pod Management:**
            
            * Create a pod: `kubectl run <pod_name> --image=<image_name>`
                
            * Get pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod_name>`
                
            * Execute a command in a pod: `kubectl exec <pod_name> -- <command>`
                
            * Port forwarding to a pod: `kubectl port-forward <pod_name> <local_port>:<pod_port>`
                
        3. **Deployment and Scaling:**
            
            * Create a deployment: `kubectl create deployment <deployment_name> --image=<image_name>`
                
            * Scale a deployment: `kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=<num_replicas>`
                
            * Update a deployment: `kubectl set image deployment/<deployment_name> <container_name>=<new_image>`
                
            * Rollback a deployment: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment_name>`
                
        4. **Services and Networking:**
            
            * Create a service: `kubectl expose <resource_type> <resource_name> --port=<port> --target-port=<target_port> --type=<service_type>`
                
            * Get service information: `kubectl get services`
                
            * Describe a service: `kubectl describe service <service_name>`
                
            * Ingress: Define an Ingress resource to route external traffic to services
                
        5. **Configuration and Secrets:**
            
            * Create a config map: `kubectl create configmap <configmap_name> --from-file=<file_path>`
                
            * Create a secret: `kubectl create secret generic <secret_name> --from-literal=<key>=<value>`
                
            * Mount a config map or secret as a volume in a pod: Use the `volumeMounts` and `volumes` fields in a pod's configuration
                
        
        Please note that this cheat sheet covers some basic commands and concepts. Kubernetes is a vast and complex topic, and it's recommended to refer to official Kubernetes documentation and resources for more in-depth information and best practices.
