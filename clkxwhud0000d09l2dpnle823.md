### ¬†üòéDaily Tasks:

\-Make sure the pipeline is running smoothly- He needs to make sure the CI/CD pipeline is intact & fixing any issue or failure with it is the topmost priority

they often need to spend time on troubleshooting, analyzing and providing fixes to issues

\-Interaction with other teams - Coordination and collaboration is the key for DevOps to be successful & hence a daily integration with development and the QA team, Program management, IT and other stakeholders is always required.

\-Working on Automation Backlog - Automation is the soul of DevOps, troubleshooting ,analyzing and providing resolution.

\-Infrastructure Management -Managing the Infra require for CI/CD pipeline & making sure that it is up and being executed optimally so this is also a part of their daily schedule eg: Working on a backup and making sure that the systems are always highly available and a new platform setup & so on

\-Dealing with Legacy stuff not everyone is lucky to work on the latest and newest systems,so they need to support it or migrate it to the latest version.

\-Exploration- DevOps leverage a lot from the various tools which are available & they are many options as open source so the team needs to regularly check on this to make sure the adoptions are as per the requirement and this can be done on a regular basis not daily.

\-Remove Bottleneck - identify the bottlenecks or the manual handshakes and work with everyone involved that is the development,QA and other stakeholders who remove them so that the team spends a good amount of time in finding such things and build the automation backlog

\-Documentation- it is a lesser known part but imp part on a daily basis beat server information daily week charted or scrum or kanban board or simple steps to configure or modify the infra so need to spend a good amount of time in coming up with these artifacts.

\-Training & Self-Development- It is very important to learn something new every day,

\-Continuous Improvement for practice- To build awareness on the potential of CI CD & DevOps practices and build a culture of leveraging it for doing things better that is reducing the rework and increasing the productivity and also optimizing the use of existing resources so you must go and talk to people to build DevOps and continuous improvement culture.

üòÅ¬†**REAL Time Scenarios:**\-

First and foremost tasks that you do is the daily stand-up meetings

¬†Your Team that are involved in DevOps,Development,QA , Operations meet together to discuss on what needs to be done and how it needs to be [done. Team](http://done.Team) lead will be assigned a specific task for that particular day & he will also take the feedback of your work at the end of the day.

¬†1. Check your mail & JIRA tickets which tell the task for the day(not for the entire week)

1. Check notifications from monitoring systems (Grafana,Zabbix) for continuos monitoring(health & security),after your deploy your applications of production servers.
    

1. Check critical alerts are unattended- Critical notifications or messages related to your DevOps teams or application it is your responsibility to make sure it is unattended or may be you need to work on it or the required person to do it.
    

1. Help & support to developers - Talk to the developers to help them write the code elegantly & efficiently after that it's your responsiblity to move it to further stages,testing , integration,deployment & so on.
    

1. Support for Prod servers:- Once the application is deployed you must track the running of the app whether it running smoothly or not or any errors make it robust.Before deploying to Prod servers the application is developed in the continuous developtment phase it might be possible that the environment in which the app was developed in development was different than the environment that we have on the prod, so bcoz of this mismatch in the environment on production and development so the application might not run smoothly. Check the environment is correct all the dependencies issues are resolved as far as the app is concerned.
    

1. Automation of Admin repetitive tasks - Since you know one scripting language it is ur responsibility to automate those tasks by writing scripts for the tasks.
    
2. Jenkins Job for deployment- The basic unit of execution in Jenkins is a job,as a DevOps Engineer you need to execute Jobs,you have to integrate the code and then you prepare a CICD pipeline.
    
3. Support Existing Infra:- Maintain and check the overall infra of your DevOps to figure out whether it is sufficient or not. if it is not sufficient talk to the required members or authorities and make sure you add additional infra or you expand it & if the need arises you also can add new servers to your infra.
    
4. Deployment of code successful or not:
    
5. Check for proper approvals has been given or not for the code releases: Say you have to develop an app with 20 features,you will not develop it for 20 but 5 features and then release it .you will check the performance of that app with the 5 features and also will take the feedback from users whether the app is running well and users are liking it or not,how the feautres are and then you again release the applications with few more features say for eg. in the first version there were 5 feautures now you have 10 features plus the feedback of the first 5 features so this the 2nd iteration of the second version of the application.
    

This is how your application is launched and it is deployed on Prod servers version by version or you can say iterations & again you take the final feedback of the application. This is one of the most important thing that DevOps do to increase the quality.

Every company works on Building and Releasing the applications , releasing different versions at a certain intervals of time and attaining the milestones.
