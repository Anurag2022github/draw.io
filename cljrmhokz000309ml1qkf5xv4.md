![How to setup Grafana, Loki and promtail for monitoring docker â€” Quentin ...](https://blog.quentin-favrie.net/assets/images/grafana-03.jpg align="left")

Grafana:

* Grafana is an open-source visualization and monitoring tool that allows you to create interactive dashboards and graphs for various data sources.
    
* Key Features:
    
    * Supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, and more.
        
    * Provides a rich set of visualization options like graphs, tables, heatmaps, and alerting.
        
    * Offers templating and dashboard variables for dynamic and flexible dashboards.
        
    * Allows for easy sharing and collaboration of dashboards with team members.
        
* Useful Commands/Actions:
    
    * Start Grafana service: `systemctl start grafana-server`
        
    * Access Grafana web interface: `http://<Grafana_IP>:<Port>`
        
    * Install Grafana plugins: `grafana-cli plugins install <plugin_name>`
        
    * Reload Grafana configuration: `systemctl reload grafana-server`
        

Loki:

* Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available log aggregation system designed to work seamlessly with Grafana.
    
* Key Features:
    
    * Stores logs as chunks in object storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage).
        
    * Utilizes labels and indexing to efficiently query and filter logs.
        
    * Supports log streams and log labels for better log organization.
        
    * Provides efficient storage and retrieval of logs.
        
* Useful Commands/Actions:
    
    * Start Loki service: `loki -config.file=loki-config.yml`
        
    * Access Loki web interface: `http://<Loki_IP>:<Port>`
        
    * Query logs from Loki CLI: `loki -config.file=loki-config.yml query <query_expression>`
        

Promtail:

* Promtail is an agent that collects and sends logs to Loki for storage and querying.
    
* Key Features:
    
    * Collects logs from various sources, such as local files, systemd journals, and Kubernetes pods.
        
    * Adds labels and metadata to logs for better categorization and querying.
        
    * Provides log enrichment capabilities through log relabeling.
        
    * Supports efficient log shipping to Loki via HTTP or gRPC.
        
* Useful Commands/Actions:
    
    * Start Promtail service: `promtail -config.file=promtail-config.yml`
        
    * Check Promtail logs: `journalctl -u promtail.service`
        
    * Verify Promtail configuration: `promtail -config.file=promtail-config.yml -dry-run`
        

Remember to replace `<Grafana_IP>`, `<Port>`, `<Loki_IP>`, `<query_expression>`, `<plugin_name>`, `<Promtail_IP>`, and `<Promtail_Port>` with the appropriate values for your setup.
